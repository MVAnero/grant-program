### Ecosystem Fit
We are a team who is only focus on our goals, that's why we can't compare ourselves to any other NFT project. 
Since the beggining we have shown a full committment to our community, we keep building, no matter what, not even market conditions. 
We are a passionate team who works day and night to bring more members to Vechain, collaborating with other blockchains and interacting with non-crypto people.
